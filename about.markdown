### Hi! My name is Isabella Xinyi Qiao and I'm a software developer. 
![image](/assets/about3.jpg){:width="500px"}

I'm from Xi'an China, currently attending [University of Michigan - Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), majoring in Computer Science. I teach EECS 376: Foundations of Computer Science. I'm a passionate software developer and work at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) and [Alvarez & Marsal](https://www.alvarezandmarsal.com/) where I develop applications for valuation and financial reporting. 

When I'm not coding, I enjoy singing with my A Cappella group, songwriting, and singing and playing my favorite songs on the piano. 

Contact me if you wanna chat :)
